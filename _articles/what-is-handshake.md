# What is Handshake?

Handshake is building an alternative to digital certificate
authorities using blockchain technology. It’s a new system for the
internet namespace that builds security, openness, and reliability
into the protocol right from the start.

We believe that Handshake will spark a new era of development in
decentralized and secure internet protocols, which aims to
redistribute ownership and control among internet users around the
world.

We’re helping jump start a public internet commons, where critical
infrastructure is owned by the developers who build and sustain
it. Blockchain technology has the potential to create the internet
imagined by its first pioneers: one free from corporate or government
control. With your help, Handshake will be a key part of this
movement.

Created by a group of prominent practitioners in the crypto ecosystem,
Handshake is a blockchain project that seeks to decentralize and
secure the internet's namespace. The project creators include Joseph
Poon (architect of Lightning network and Plasma), Christopher Jeffrey
(CTO at Purse, creator of bcoin), Andrew Lee (CEO at Purse), Andrew
Lee (Chairman of London Trust Media). The list of investors includes
leading Silicon Valley venture capitalists, including Andreessen
Horowitz.

Handshake’s decentralized namespace distributes ownership among the
community through its own cryptocurrency, HNS, using a direct airdrop
to 300,000 FOSS community members. Upon launch of the main net, the
community will be able to auction and reserve top-level domains using
HNS or trade their HNS as they see fit.

## Why?

Today, the core technology for internet naming (DNS) is owned and
controlled by one company, located in L.A. With Handshake, the core
naming technology is owned and controlled by the entire developer
community. This is done in a transparent, verifiable way enabled by
the crypto that the blockchain provides.  ​ Handshake prevents names
from being censored or taken over; it also helps prevent tracking and
retention of name requests by users. This system takes the power from
the hands of corporations and instead gives it to the developer
community.

## How?

Rather than paying money to faceless corporations for registering
names, Handshake lets you obtain and relinquish names using tokens. To
help jump start Handshake and ensure that it’s owned by the community,
we’re giving away these tokens, first to the open source developers of
the world, and then to the world itself in what we call the ‘airdrop
to humanity.’ Names are used across the globe, so the core naming
service should be owned and operated by the world.  ​ VCs and other
firms are publicly backing the Handshake system and its future impact
on the internet by backing the value of these tokens. With this
investment, obtaining publicly available names is given an inherent
cost and value. Thanks to the blockchain powering it, concrete name
ownership and censorship resilience is guaranteed.  ​ Handshake can
work with the existing TLDs (e.g., com, net, org) to ensure existing
names continue to work as expected. Handshake manages this by
deprecating the need for the root DNS servers. Right now, anyone can
point existing TLDs towards their respective nameservers. Eventually,
we hope to provide the names currently associated with TLDs using
Handshake's core protocols and are actively working to facilitate
that. In addition to this, major privacy and security-focused TLDs
such as onion are given first-class support within the Handshake
system.
 
## General information

### Nonprofits

#### Why is Handshake donating $10.2 million USD to nonprofits?

We believe in social good as a motivating factor. Our commitment to
the free and open source software community is absolute. Instead of
enriching ourselves, we’ve taken the validation value from this
project and shared it with the world.

Building a new DNS for the world is not something any single
organization can do on its own. That’s why we’re giving away the
$10.2m USD we’ve raised from investors to well-known open source
organizations and developers, including Mozilla, Open Rights Group,
and the Apache Foundation.

#### Why do we need decentralized names on the internet?

DNS today is not secure and is vulnerable to DDoS attacks. Compromised
certificate authorities threaten SSL. Billions of dollars in
cryptocurrency are currently being moved around on potentially
insecure websites. If you’re personally identifiable as the owner of a
valuable asset, there’s a risk to your personal safety. Anonymised
registration would end the risk of being held for ransom.

#### How is Handshake different from other decentralized naming projects?

Some naming projects were too early. The systems do not allow for
secure “light clients” (simple payment verification mode), so you
would need to run a full node, equivalent to saving all the domains in
the world on your computer. Also, prior efforts didn’t pre-reserve
names for existing rights holders.

In contrast, Handshake creates a shared investment on time and
interest that represents support in the project. We make certificate
authorities obsolete and secure SSL. With our robust technology, name
lookup is faster than regular DNS (2msec/JJ). Handshake is more
resilient to DDoS attacks and makes censorship exceptionally difficult
because of the blockchain. We are not replacing domain names but your
username for the entire internet, with secure services on top of
that. Also, the top 100,000 pre-reserved names will be given to
existing rights holders (e.g., Apple and Google) to prevent name
squatting.

#### Why is Handshake distributing coins to free and open source developers?

We want to establish the means for free and open source developers to
provide a gift to the world. The handshake blockchain will start with
1.36 billion coins, of which 77.5% will be distributed to open source
developers. [add more about social incentives]

#### Why should I trust a new blockchain project with critical internet naming?

Firstly, Handshake will initially work alongside the current domain
name system, co-existing with the root zone. The most visited 100,000
top-level domains will be reserved for existing name holders, so we
will support users who want to preserve their conventional DNS.

Crucially, Handshake has clear advantages over the traditional naming
and signature systems. Using the Handshake blockchain means avoiding
the security vulnerabilities of conventional DNS, which include DDoS
attacks on name servers and cache

### Technical

#### How do I register a name?

To start, it will be a simple command-line interface for the name
buying and auction process.

Technical users can bid directly by interacting with the blockchain
using the auction mechanism. Users are in full control and responsible
for maintaining their keys.

Non-technical users can use the websites/services that appear wherever
they register. These services will participate in the decentralized
auction system on the user’s behalf, similar to going to godaddy.com
and registering there. The service would bid on the user’s behalf and
after they win the auction, the service would maintain the keys for
the user.

#### What does the auction process look like?

All possible names are released weekly over the first year after
launch. People can submit blinded bids any time afterwards. After the
first bid, everyone else can place bids; after one week, bidding is
closed. Everyone who bids has one week to reveal their bid
price. After the second week, a winner is chosen. The losers get back
their coins, and the winner receives the name with their coins being
permanently removed from the system (“burned coins”).

#### How do I transfer ownership?

If one owns a name directly, the current recipient can give the
destination address/key of the new recipient. They create a
transaction to send the domain to someone else and is minded in a
block on the blockchain. After a week, the transaction is confirmed
and the transfer is locked in. This transaction transferring ownership
can also have payments embedded so that the recipient will receive
coins if and only if the transfer is successful (This means that one
does not need to use a third-party escrow to pay for transfer.).

#### What is the challenge for secure name resolution?

The largest challenge is the “key exchange problem.” This can be
solved by putting the certificate and names on the blockchain.

#### What if I have an open source project -- how do I apply?

If your open source project isn’t a non-profit, don’t worry! You can
still benefit by participating in our FOSS community
airdrop. Handshake coins are being distributed now.

#### I am involved with an open source project but we are not an incorporated entity.Can we still apply?

If your open source project isn’t a non-profit, don’t worry! You can
still benefit by participating in our FOSS community
airdrop. Handshake coins are being distributed now.
